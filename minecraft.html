     About the game: Minecraft is a widely popular sandbox video game developed by Mojang Studios. 
Released in 2011, it allows players to explore, build, and create in a procedurally generated 3D world made up of blocks representing various materials like dirt, stone, 
wood, and ores. The game's open-ended nature means there are no specific goals, enabling players to engage in a variety of activities, from crafting tools and building structures to exploring vast 
landscapes and battling creatures known as "mobs" <!--Info from https://www.perplexity.ai/search/write-what-minecraft-is-about-SYaA9mLxSlOnZEZ_sgFQEg -->
